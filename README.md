## 📌 Problem Statement

As health consciousness grows, individuals seek personalized nutrition advice rather than generic diet charts. However, existing tools fail to adapt in real time or consider important lifestyle factors, medical conditions, allergies, or food culture.

There is a growing need for a **scalable, intelligent nutrition assistant** that can provide **personalized, dynamic dietary recommendations** — adapting to individual needs and feedback.

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution

This project introduces a Smart AI Nutrition Assistant powered by IBM Granite and Watsonx.ai. It dynamically generates meal plans, provides nutrition advice, and suggests healthy food swaps — all based on user inputs.

### 🔹 Features:
- Understands natural language inputs (text/voice)
- Personalizes based on goals, conditions, allergies, culture
- Generates meal plans and explains food recommendations
- Supports safe, adaptive suggestions via user feedback

### 🔧 Components:
- **User Input Collection** (text/voice)
- **Data Handling** with IBM Cloudant (profiles, history)
- **Prompt-based Reasoning** using IBM Granite LLM
- **Frontend Interface** (React/HTML – optional)
- **REST API Backend** via IBM Cloud Functions

---

## 🛠️ System Development Approach

### 🔹 IBM Tools Used:
- `Watsonx.ai` (Prompt Lab)
- `Granite LLM` (Text model)
- `IBM Cloud Functions` (API logic)
- `IBM Cloudant DB` (user storage)
- `IBM Cloud Object Storage` *(optional image-based inputs)*
- `Frontend` – Basic React or HTML form *(optional)*

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm & Deployment

### 🔸 Algorithm:
- No ML training required.  
- Uses prompt engineering with IBM Granite to map user inputs to meal/nutrition logic.

### 🔸 Input:
- User goals, diet preferences, allergies, medical needs

### 🔸 Process:
- Prompts passed to LLM → Nutrition rules applied → Meal generated

### 🔸 Output:
- Meal plan + Nutrition tip + Substitution + Safety checks

### 🔸 Deployment:
- IBM Cloud Functions for API logic  
- IBM Cloudant for persistent user data  
- Deployed as a REST API  
- Optional chatbot/UI to interface with users

## 🧪 Sample Output (Result)

> **User**: "I want to lose 5 kg. I’m vegetarian and lactose-intolerant."  
> **Agent**: "Here’s a low-calorie meal:  
> - Quinoa upma with mixed vegetables  
> - Coconut yogurt with berries  
> - Green tea (no sugar)  
> This plan is dairy-free, nutrient-dense, and aligned with your goals."

## ✅ Conclusion

The Smart AI Nutrition Assistant solves the personalization problem in diet planning using IBM’s generative AI. It delivers adaptive, safe, and explainable guidance, removing the need for static logic or generic diet charts.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Image-based food recognition (OCR + Granite vision models)
- Multi-language input support
- Wearable integration (calorie, activity sync)
- Weekly feedback-based dynamic goals
